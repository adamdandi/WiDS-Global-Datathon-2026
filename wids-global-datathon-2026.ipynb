When a new fire ignites, emergency managers must answer urgent questions immediately with very limited information. They need to decide which communities to warn, which roads to close, and where to send scarce resources like planes and crews. This project focuses on building a data-driven tool to help these commanders make life-saving decisions during the chaotic early stages of a fire.\n\n### **The Context: The First Five Hours**\n\nThe scenario focuses strictly on the \"golden hour\" of disaster response. The analysis uses data collected only from the **first five hours** after a fire is detected.\n\nDuring this short window, sensors record three main types of behavior:\n\n* **Growth:** How quickly the fire's size is increasing.\n* **Movement:** The speed and direction the fire travels across the land.\n* **Position:** How close the fire is to safety zones and whether it is accelerating toward them.\n\nThe objective is to take these early signals and forecast the future. The model must predict if and when the fire will cross a 5-kilometer safety line near a populated area.\n\n### **The Problem: Scarcity and Uncertainty**\n\nPredicting these outcomes is difficult because the data is both small and \"censored.\"\n\n* **Data Scarcity:** Real-world disaster data is rare. This dataset contains only 316 historical fire events. This is a very small number for computer learning, making it easy to accidentally \"memorize\" the past instead of learning the rules of fire behavior.\n* **Censored Data (The \"Non-Events\"):** In many historical cases, the fire never reached the town within the 3-day window. It might have burned out or moved away. In statistics, this is called \"censored data.\" The model cannot simply treat these as errors or ignore them; it must learn from the fires that *didn't* hit just as much as the ones that did.\n\nA simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" prediction is not useful here. A \"Yes\" is meaningless if the fire arrives in 12 hours but the model predicts it will take 72. Responders need to know *when* the danger peaks.\n\n### **The Expectation: A Timeline of Risk**\n\nThe goal is to generate a calibrated probability forecast, similar to a weather report, rather than a single guess.\n\nFor every fire event, the output must provide four specific risk probabilities:\n\n1. Chance of threat within **12 hours**.\n2. Chance of threat within **24 hours**.\n3. Chance of threat within **48 hours**.\n4. Chance of threat within **72 hours**.\n\n**Success is measured by two standards:**\n\n* **Ranking (Triage):** Can the model correctly list fires in order of urgency? It must verify that the fire listed as \"most dangerous\" is actually the one that hits first.\n* **Calibration (Trust):** Are the percentages realistic? If the model predicts an 80% chance of danger, the event should actually happen 80% of the time. This reliability allows commanders to trust the numbers when lives are at risk.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Step 1: Data Loading and Feature Engineering\n\nObjective:\n\n1.
